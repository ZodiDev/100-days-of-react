# 100-days-of-react
**Introduction**

Day 1: Blog Project
Date: October 18, 2023

**Today's Learning:**

Props. I learned how props work and function in React.

**Resources Used:**

Tailwindcss documentation

Brocode Tutorial on Props [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvEAvxWvwOs]

**Today's Project:**

Name: Blog
Description: A very basic blog website
Demo: [Link to deployed demo, e.g. on Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.]

**Challenges Faced:**

Setting up the best work environment. It ended up being alot of changes later on
Installing tailwind in vite

**What I'd Do Differently:**

Firsly reading what exactly to do in the documentation and looking up how to do one thing in vite since it might be different depending on what react library you use

Planning better on how I can build this

Add a little more animation to make it seem more dynamic

I would want to make it so that I can add blog in an easier way so I don't have to hard code it. Which means I would need to spend more time on my projects

Thoughts & Reflection:

I tend to jump right into things without taking a step back and think about what I want to do and how to do it. I need to take it a little easier. This is a problem I have for many things but today it showed how much that can slow me down.
I did create a decent looking website without looking up too much, maybe I would want to look up a little so that I can learn new things but I am still kinda proud.
