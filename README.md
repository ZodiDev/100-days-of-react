# 100-days-of-react

## Introduction

I've always aspired to be a developer, but I've felt my skills lag behind others'. Although I've been coding intermittently for several years, my progress hasn't been as swift as I'd hoped. Thus, I embarked on this challenge to push myself and enhance my programming skills.

## Day 1: Blog Project
Date: October 18, 2023

### Today's Learning

Props: Gained an understanding of how props function within React.

### Resources Used

Tailwindcss documentation

Brocode Tutorial on Props [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvEAvxWvwOs]

### Today's Project

Name: Blog

Description: A fundamental blog website

Demo: [Link to the deployed demo, e.g., on Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.]

### Challenges Faced

- Fine-tuning the optimal work environment led to numerous modifications.
- Integrating tailwind with vite.

### What I'd Do Differently

- Prioritize thoroughly reading the documentation and understanding the nuances of implementing features in vite, especially since implementations can vary based on the React library in use.
  
- Strategize more effectively about the construction of the project.
  
- Introduce subtle animations to enhance the dynamic feel.
  
- Aim for a more streamlined approach to adding blog content, avoiding hardcoding, which would warrant dedicating more time to each project.

### Thoughts & Reflection

I often dive headfirst into tasks without pausing to strategize. It's essential for me to pace myself. This tendency isn't exclusive to coding but manifests in various areas of my life. Today's experience highlighted how this approach can be counterproductive. Nevertheless, I managed to design a respectable website with minimal external assistance. While I take pride in this, I also recognize the potential benefits of occasionally seeking out external resources to broaden my knowledge.
